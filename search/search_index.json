What does MariaDB plugin do? \u00b6 The Delphix MariaDB Plugin can virtualize a single instance MariaDB database and create multiple virtual copies as required. There are two modes of operation of the plugin based on how the MariaDB dSource is created and kept in-sync with source database. Replication \u00b6 In the Replication mode, Delphix uses MariaDB's built-in replication technology to keep the Delphix dSource in-sync with the MariaDB source databases. Creation of the dSource requires a full backup of the source database(s) and there are two options to providing this backup. Delphix Managed Backup In this option, Delphix is provided with the required information to take a full backup of the source database. User Provided Backup In this option, user provides Delphix with an existing full backup. Delphix initializes the staging database using the full backup and configures the staging database as a replicated slave of the source database. MariaDB Replication keeps the data in the staging database in-sync with the source. Manual Ingestion \u00b6 In the Manual Ingestion mode, the data in Delphix dSource is managed manually by the end users. Delphix creates a seed MariaDB staging database which can be managed via Delphix. The end user assumes the responsibility of keeping the data in the staging database in-sync with the source database. Where to Start? \u00b6 By now, you must have an overall idea of what is possible with the MariaDB plugin. Before you can get started with virtualizing your MariaDB databases, there are some pre-requisites you need to take care of. Please visit the Pre-Requisites page for more details.

However, Delphix needs to be able to manage this staging database for snapshots and other time travel operations. Hence, we require a user with the following permissions on the staging database. SELECT, SHUTDOWN, SUPER, RELOAD ,SHOW VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER There are 2 ways to achieve this Create this user on your source database so that when the backup is restored, this user is present in the staging db. Create this user manually in the staging db. In this case, the customer user must ensure that this user is always present in the staging db and has the necessary privileges mysql>CREATE USER 'delphix_os'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'delphix_user_passwd'; 3. Grant the necessary privileges to the user. mysql> GRANT SELECT, SHUTDOWN, SUPER, RELOAD ,SHOW VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER on *.* to 'delphix_os'@'localhost'; You can also grant more permissive privileges mysql>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%'; Note Remember, this is the user that Delphix uses to manage the Staging database. So, if you're using Option#1 above, it is recommended that you create a dedicated source db user for Delphix with the privileges mentioned above. Staging Environment Requirements \u00b6 Staging OS User \u00b6 This is a typical Delphix OS staging user. Key requirements for this user are given below. Please refer to Delphix Docs for more detailed requirements.
